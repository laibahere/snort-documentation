Welcome to Snort's documentation!
=================================

Snort is an open-source network-based :ref:`Intrusion Detection and Prevention System <idso>` (IDS/IPS) that provides real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on Internet Protocol (IP) networks.

It excels in both detecting and preventing intrusions by analyzing live traffic, triggering alerts, logging suspicious activities, and rejecting harmful packets.

Additionally, Snort functions as a network sniffer, intercepting and inspecting packets to prevent various types of threats, making it an essential tool for maintaining network security.

Snort operates based on a set of custom rules designed for detecting and responding to specific threats, ensuring a high level of adaptability and precision in threat management.
