Snowl: A GUI-Based Snort Interface
==================================

Snowl is a modern web-based GUI (graphical user interface) designed specifically for Snort, an open-source IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention System). Unlike Snort's traditional command-line interface, Snowl provides an intuitive platform that automates Snort configuration and enhances threat analysis capabilities.

Snowl features a real-time dashboard that provides instant insights into network activities and potential threats. Its powerful and flexible filtration system allows users to create custom filters to focus on specific types of traffic or threats. Snowl offers various ways to display and analyze detected attacks, including detailed logs and visualizations, making threat management more accessible and user-friendly.

Whether you're new to network security or a seasoned professional, Snowl simplifies the complexity of Snort's setup and operation, offering a seamless experience for configuring rules and monitoring network traffic. It aims to make Snort's capabilities more accessible by providing a graphical interface that automates settings and enhances the analysis of security events.
